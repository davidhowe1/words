#### Words is a simple program that uses the WordsAPI to generate information about English words.
#### You can search for definitions, use examples, rhyming words, synonyms, antonyms, syllable count, frequency and pronounciation.
#### To use the app, type a word in the search bar and press search. The default search is set to definitions but you can change the information you want to see by clicking the settings tab next to the "Search Word" button. This will give you a list of the search criteria as mentioned above. 

For example, you might want to find some words that rhyme with "Plant". Type plant in the search bar, make sure the search criteria of "Rhyme" is selected in the options and click "Search Word" to generate the results.
